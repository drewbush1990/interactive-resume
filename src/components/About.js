      <p>
        Hi, I'm Andrew Bush, a passionate software engineer who thrives on solving 
        complex problems through innovative technology solutions. With a 
        <strong> B.S. in Computer Science </strong> from Oregon State University (GPA: 3.6), I have honed 
        my skills in building scalable systems, cloud computing, and software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve collaborated on projects like AI bots using reinforcement learning, 
        optimized autonomous vehicle software, and developed augmented reality applications. My expertise includes 
        Python, JavaScript, React, C++, and cloud technologies such as AWS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond technology, I’m an advocate for continuous learning, driven by a deep passion for 
        <strong>autonomous driving technology, AI glasses,</strong> and <strong>open-source AI/ML initiatives.</strong> 
        I’m always excited to push the boundaries of innovation and collaborate with others to create meaningful impact.
